This folder hosts are the database schema migrations.

Each file has a name and a sequence number at the end.

If you make any changes to the database "schema", create a new file in this folder. 
The filename should indicate the changes made to the schema briefly. The file should have the first lines in comments, describing in detail about the change.
[ALERT] Every file should only the changes made from the most recent state of DB. Don't put the entire schema dump, just include the delta change done.

So whenever there is a change, other developers will execute the new file(s) added to update their schema locally.
